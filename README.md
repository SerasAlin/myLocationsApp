This app is not complete. I spend almost 5 hours on it 
and decided to send it like this.
Add and edit functionalities are prepared, but not integrated.

NextJS with axios and SWR for api calls, mock server using pact to fetch data,
started to prepare redux for state management.

steps to get the project up and running:
npm install
npm run build
npm run mock-server (wait for few seconds for interactions to be added)
